He then began to open a homemade sushi catering service for major hotels in the city such as the Marriott Ch√¢teau Champlain, the Delta, the Hilton and many others. Seeing its popularity grow at lightning speed, Mr. Chiem decided to expand his services by offering private lessons, in-home chefs and by partnering with large companies such as Las Olas and Bernard et Fils traiteur.",
